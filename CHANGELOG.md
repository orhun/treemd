  - Added `y` (copy content) and `Y` (copy anchor) handlers to link follow mode
  - Added `y`/`Y` handlers to help mode (`?`)
  - Added `y`/`Y` handlers to theme picker mode (`t`)
  - Previously only worked in normal mode, causing confusion for users

### Added

## [0.1.7] - 2025-01-10

### Fixed

- **Tab completion for current directory files** - Fixed bug where `treemd R<tab>` wouldn't complete to `README.md` in the current directory. Path::parent() returns empty string for simple filenames, which is now normalized to "." for proper completion matching.

### Added

- **Filename in title bar** - Title bar now displays the filename being viewed: "treemd - README.md - 15 headings"
- **Current heading in content pane** - Content pane header now shows the selected heading name instead of the generic "Content" label, providing better context while reading

### Changed

- **App struct enhancement** - Added `filename` field to track the source file for display purposes
- **Content pane title logic** - Title dynamically updates based on selected heading, falling back to "Content" when none selected

### Technical

- Normalized empty parent paths in file completer to fix `Path::new("R").parent()` returning `Some("")` instead of `Some(".")`
- Extracted filename from PathBuf when launching TUI mode using `file_name()` and `to_str()`

## [0.1.6] - 2025-01-09

### Fixed

- **TUI section extraction with inline markdown** - Fixed critical bug where selecting headings with inline formatting (like `**bold**`) would display the entire document instead of just that section
- **JSON output content extraction** - Fixed nested JSON output where parent sections incorrectly included child heading text in their content
- **Parent directory completions** - Shell completions now work with `../` relative paths and absolute paths, enabling navigation to parent directories

### Added

- **Offset-based parsing** - Implemented pulldown-cmark's `into_offset_iter()` for direct byte offset tracking, eliminating fragile string searching
- **Shared utilities module** - Created `parser/utils.rs` with `strip_markdown_inline()` and `get_heading_level()` helpers
- **Comprehensive test suite** - Added 8+ new tests covering bold headings, numbered headings, offset tracking, and section extraction edge cases
- **Context-aware completions** - Upgraded from `ArgValueCandidates` to `ArgValueCompleter` for dynamic path-based completions

### Changed

- **Heading struct enhancement** - Added `offset: usize` field to store byte position for O(1) section extraction
- **Parser optimization** - Changed from O(n²) string searching to O(n) offset-based extraction
- **Code deduplication** - Eliminated 40+ lines of duplicate code by centralizing utilities
- **Completion logic** - Completions now parse input path to determine target directory and filter appropriately

### Technical

- **DRY principle compliance** - Removed duplicate `strip_markdown_inline` and `get_heading_level` functions
- **Best practices adoption** - Using pulldown-cmark's built-in offset tracking as recommended by Rust markdown ecosystem
- **Performance improvement** - Section extraction now O(1) lookup instead of O(n) string search
- **Robustness improvement** - Handles all inline markdown formatting (bold, italic, code, strikethrough) correctly
- **Architecture cleanup** - Better separation of concerns with dedicated utils module
- **Zero clippy warnings** - Clean codebase with all lints addressed

## [0.1.5] - 2025-11-09

- **Binary corruption in releases** - Wrap binaries in platform-appropriate archives to preserve file permissions and prevent corruption through GitHub Actions artifact system
- **Executable permissions lost** - Fixed issue where Unix binaries lost +x permission during artifact upload/download
- **SHA256 mismatch** - Generate checksums at build time and verify after extraction to ensure binary integrity
- **Cache conflicts** - Use unique cache keys per target to prevent 409 conflicts in parallel builds
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Use native tools on each platform (PowerShell on Windows, bash on Unix)

### Added

- **Individual SHA256 files** - Each binary now has a corresponding .sha256 file generated at build time
- **Combined SHA256SUMS** - All binaries included in a single SHA256SUMS file in releases for easy verification
- **Checksum verification** - Automated verification step that checksums match after artifact extraction
- **Build-time checksums** - SHA256 printed during build for traceability

  - Pinned to commit 8633ec6 (Nov 2025) for reproducibility
  - Follows 2025 best practices for actively-developed-but-not-released projects

### Technical

- Unix: tar.gz archives preserve executable permissions through artifact system
- Windows: zip archives created with PowerShell's Compress-Archive

- **Enhanced help system** - Comprehensive `--help` menu with detailed descriptions, examples, and usage patterns
- **Setup instructions** - Clear instructions for manual completion setup if automated setup is declined

### Changed

- **Feature enablement** - `unstable-dynamic` feature now enabled by default for seamless completion experience
